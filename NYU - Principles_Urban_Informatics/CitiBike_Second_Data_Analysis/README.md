### Markdown file for the Assignment_1 of Homework_4 is attached in the main (HW4_aes807) repository as (Assignment_1.md)
#### (aes807) to create and complete the evaluation of Xinge Zhong - (xz1809)
#### Forked, Cloned and Written .md file

### ------------------------------------------

### Worked with Priyanshi Singh (ps3369) on this assignment
### We worked in conjunction and discussion throughtout the assignment

### Part - I (Choosing two from the First Half of the Table to use as a guideline)

#### Statistical Analysis done on a paper published that involved both MANCOVA and ANCOVA tests - so I thought it would be best to use this paper so that I can get exposed and learn about how both can be used simultaneously and how two different tests are clubbed togeather to show a single result.

#### Here MANCOVA's were used first and ANCOVA's were used inside/follow up of the MANCOVA tests to determine/understand certain Interdependent qualities

### Part - II (Choosing one from the Second Half of the Table to use as a guideline)

#### Statistical Analysis done on a paper published that involved the Logistic Regression test. Here this uses archaeological data to relate the variable that is highly affected by the change in the Independent Variables.

## Task 3:

- Copied and pasted the notebook into my personal notebook and worked on it from compute directly - did not use the same notebook as the instructor - this might show some irregularities with the code and the boxes that needed to be completed.

- Worked on the assignment from the instructors notes and used code to fill up the blanks in the code.

- Used Google and help from other students in the class to understand the coding aspect of writing statistics - code may be similar to a few people due to the help I have taken from them.

- Read friends' codes to try and understand how to frame sentences for proving in words why the rejection/acceptance was done for a particular hypothesis.
